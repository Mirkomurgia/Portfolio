# ML Tumor Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (ml_tumor.ipynb) for tumor classification using some Machine Learning techniques.

## Content
 
**ml_tumor.ipynb** : A Jupyter Notebook with code for training and evaluating a Machine Learning model for tumor classification.

The notebook loads and preprocesses data related to benign and malignant tumors. With the implementation of various Machine Learning algorithms, including:
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
- Evaluation Metrics: Model performance analysis using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
